# Amazon Price Scraper

A simple Python script that scrapes the price of a product on Amazon and logs it into a CSV file. This project uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and allows you to track the price changes over time.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`BeautifulSoup`, `requests`).
3. Run the script.

## Configuration
- Adjust the `URL` variable in the script to track the price of a different product.

## Dataset
The script appends product title, price, and the date to the `AmazonWebScraperDataset.csv` file.
